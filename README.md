# 🏥 Insurance Premium Prediction Project

> **🚀 Project Status:** Phase 1 Completed (Champion Model Selected)

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict health insurance premiums based on personal attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. The goal was to build a highly accurate regression model to assist in automated premium estimation.

## 🏆 Champion Model: Random Forest Regressor

After rigorous testing and comparison of multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest), we have selected the **Random Forest Regressor** as our production-grade model.

### 📊 Performance Metrics (Verified)

| Metric | Score | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R² Score (Accuracy)** | **97.89%** | ✅ Excellent |
| **MAE (Avg Error)** | 847.67 | ✅ Acceptable |
| **Model Artifact** | `models/champion_random_forest.pkl` | 💾 Saved |

> **Architect's Note:** The model was optimized using `max_depth=7` and feature engineering (K-Means Clustering) to achieve this high accuracy, significantly outperforming the baseline linear models.
